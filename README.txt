Note on password:
- password input is hashes (SHA-256) and first 8 Byte are used as password.
  This enables use of variable-length passwords but might not conform to other implementations.

Not implemented:
- optionally use overdrive
- optionally use RESUME cmd for DS1922L/T https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ds1922l-ds1922t.pdf
